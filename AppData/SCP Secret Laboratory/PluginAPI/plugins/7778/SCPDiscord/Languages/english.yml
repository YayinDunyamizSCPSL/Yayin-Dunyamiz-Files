#
#  You may notice many of the events below have variables of the type "Player". This means they provide a large
#  amount of variables containing different player information. You can view an up to date list of these variabels
#  in the APIExtensions.cs file in the Git repository.
#
#  Usage example:
#  If an event has an "attacker" variable of the Player type this means you can use <var:attacker-name> to get
#  their username. It works the same way for all player subvariables, except for the disarmer variable.
#  The disarmer variable is also a player type, so if the "attacker" player from before was disarmed you could
#  get the name of the disarming player using <var:attacker-disarmer-name>.
#
#  List of Player sub-variables:
#  -ipaddress
#  -name
#  -id
#  -userid
#  -role
#  -team
#  -donottrack
#  -health
#  -isdisarmed
#  -isalive
#  -ismuted
#  -hasreservedslot
